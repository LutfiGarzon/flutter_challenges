# flutter_challenges

A special thanks to my ❤️ moshi ❤️ who inspired me to make this list of exercises to learn flutter

## Getting Started

This project uses [fvm (Flutter Version Management package)](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation)
First activate `fvm` with the command.
```
dart pub global activate fvm
```

Then run the command.
```
fvm use
```

Now you can install your flutter version.
```
fvm flutter clean && fvm flutter pub get
```

### Run an specific challenge
In the `main.dart` main function you can specify which challenge to run each challenge start with `App{ChallengeName}`.

```dart
void main() {
  // TODO: Replace for the challenge to do.
  runApp(const App{ChallengeName}());
}
```

You gonna be workin under the specific `// TODO:` add your code below on what you think is the solution to each specific issue.

each challenge will have an `readme` file with the information needed to work on each challenge.
